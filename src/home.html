      <p>Welcome to MKB Trainer! This website is designed to help users become more effective gamers with mouse and keyboard.
        You can run though a lot of tests for mouse and keyboard. When playing a game you do not use one or the other, both
        need practice. Everything from reaction time to accuracy will be tested. When testing please keep in mind this website
        is all html, javascript, and css meaning it can only be so close to actual game conditions. If you are on your home
        PC, actual games make sense, otherwise if you are remote and cannot install games this is the site for you. Enjoy!
      </p>

      <h1>About</h1>
      <p>
        My name is James and I am a long time console gamer, I started in NES and had consoles all the way through PS4. Spring of 2017 my friends and
        I sold our PS4's in favor of converting to The PC Master Race! We all purchased xbox controllers to use with our
        PC's because that is what we grew up on. In July 2017 we all started playing PlayerUnknown's Battle Grounds, which
        is mouse and keyboard. Wow, we were very bad starting out. Never using mouse/keyboard before put us all at a huge
        disadvantage, so we all are embarking on learning mouse/keyboard. Having a regular 9-5 day job, it is hard for me
        to practice as much as I would like. I made this site so I can practice on my lunches at work and I decided to share
        my creation with others!
